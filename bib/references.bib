  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Taxonomic classification of marker-gene sequences is
              an important step in microbiome analysis. RESULTS: We present
              q2-feature-classifier (
              https://github.com/qiime2/q2-feature-classifier ), a QIIME 2
              plugin containing several novel machine-learning and
              alignment-based methods for taxonomy classification. We evaluated
              and optimized several commonly used classification methods
              implemented in QIIME 1 (RDP, BLAST, UCLUST, and SortMeRNA) and
              several new methods implemented in QIIME 2 (a scikit-learn naive
              Bayes machine-learning classifier, and alignment-based taxonomy
              consensus methods based on VSEARCH, and BLAST+) for
              classification of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS marker-gene
              amplicon sequence data. The naive-Bayes, BLAST+-based, and
              VSEARCH-based classifiers implemented in QIIME 2 meet or exceed
              the species-level accuracy of other commonly used methods
              designed for classification of marker gene sequences that were
              evaluated in this work. These evaluations, based on 19 mock
              communities and error-free sequence simulations, including
              classification of simulated ``novel'' marker-gene sequences, are
              available in our extensible benchmarking framework, tax-credit (
              https://github.com/caporaso-lab/tax-credit-data ). CONCLUSIONS:
              Our results illustrate the importance of parameter tuning for
              optimizing classifier performance, and we make recommendations
              regarding parameter choices for these classifiers under a range
              of standard operating conditions. q2-feature-classifier and

               marker-gene sequencing data without resorting to the customary
               construction of molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs):
               clusters of sequencing reads that differ by less than a fixed
               dissimilarity threshold. New methods control errors sufficiently
               such that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved
               exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences over
               the sequenced gene region. The benefits of finer resolution are
               immediately apparent, and arguments for ASV methods have focused
               on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more
               important, are the broad benefits that derive from the status of
               ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning

               discuss how these features grant ASVs the combined advantages of
               closed-reference OTUs-including computational costs that scale
               linearly with study size, simple merging between independently
               processed data sets, and forward prediction-and of de novo

               applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in reference

               reproducibility and comprehensiveness are sufficiently great

              to profile microbial communities. New long-read sequencing
              technologies can sequence the entire 16S rRNA gene, but higher
              error rates have limited their attractiveness when accuracy is
              important. Here we present a high-throughput amplicon sequencing
              methodology based on PacBio circular consensus sequencing and the
              DADA2 sample inference method that measures the full-length 16S

              rate. In two artificial communities of known composition, our
              method recovered the full complement of full-length 16S sequence
              variants from expected community members without residual errors.
              The measured abundances of intra-genomic sequence variants were
              in the integral ratios expected from the genuine allelic variants
              within a genome. The full-length 16S gene sequences recovered by
              our approach allowed Escherichia coli strains to be correctly
              classified to the O157:H7 and K12 sub-species clades. In human
              fecal samples, our method showed strong technical replication and
              was able to recover the full complement of 16S rRNA alleles in
              several E. coli strains. There are likely many applications

               chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an
               adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized

               platform for computing log densities and their gradients and
               Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as
               variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal

              contaminated by microorganisms. However, the causal mechanism of
              bacterial contamination of the environment as a source of
              transmission is still debated. This prospective study was
              performed to characterize the nature of multidrug-resistant
              organism (MDRO) transmission between the environment and patients
              using standard microbiological and molecular techniques. SETTING:
              Prospective cohort study at 2 academic medical centers. DESIGN: A
              prospective multicenter study to characterize the nature of
              bacterial transfer events between patients and environmental
              surfaces in rooms that previously housed patients with 1 of 4
              'marker' MDROs: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
              vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Clostridium difficile, and MDR
              Acinetobacter baumannii. Environmental and patient
              microbiological samples were obtained on admission into a freshly
              disinfected inpatient room. Repeat samples from room surfaces and
              patients were taken on days 3 and 7 and each week the patient
              stayed in the same room. The bacterial identity, antibiotic
              susceptibility, and molecular sequences were compared between
              organisms found in the environment samples and patient sources.
              RESULTS: We enrolled 80 patient-room admissions; 9 of these
              patients (11.3\%) were asymptomatically colonized with MDROs at
              study entry. Hospital room surfaces were contaminated with MDROs
              despite terminal disinfection in 44 cases (55\%). Microbiological
              Bacterial Transfer events either to the patient, the environment,
              or both occurred in 12 patient encounters (18.5\%) from the
              microbiologically evaluable cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Microbiological
              Bacterial Transfer events between patients and the environment
              were observed in 18.5\% of patient encounters and occurred early
              in the admission. This study suggests that research on prevention
              methods beyond the standard practice of room disinfection at the
              end of a patient's stay is needed to better prevent acquisition
              of MDROs through the environment.",

              in subsequent patients who occupy the same bed. Design, Setting,
              and Participants: This is a retrospective cohort study of adult
              patients hospitalized in any 1 of 4 facilities between 2010 and
              2015. Patients were excluded if they had recent CDI, developed
              CDI within 48 hours of admission, had inadequate follow-up time,
              or if their prior bed occupant was in the bed for less than 24
              hours. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary exposure was
              receipt of non-CDI antibiotics by the prior bed occupant and the
              primary outcome was incident CDI in the subsequent patient to
              occupy the same bed. Incident CDI was defined as a positive
              result from a stool polymerase chain reaction for the C difficile
              toxin B gene followed by treatment for CDI. Demographics,
              comorbidities, laboratory data, and medication exposures are
              reported. Results: Among 100 615 pairs of patients who
              sequentially occupied a given hospital bed, there were 576 pairs
              (0.57\%) in which subsequent patients developed CDI. Receipt of
              antibiotics in prior patients was significantly associated with
              incident CDI in subsequent patients (log-rank P < .01). This
              relationship remained unchanged after adjusting for factors known
              to influence risk for CDI including receipt of antibiotics by the
              subsequent patient (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.22; 95\% CI,
              1.02-1.45) and also after excluding 1497 patient pairs among whom
              the prior patients developed CDI (aHR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.43).
              Aside from antibiotics, no other factors related to the prior bed
              occupants were associated with increased risk for CDI in
              subsequent patients. Conclusions and Relevance: Receipt of
              antibiotics by prior bed occupants was associated with increased
              risk for CDI in subsequent patients. Antibiotics can directly
              affect risk for CDI in patients who do not themselves receive
              antibiotics.",

              $\vartheta$1− $\vartheta$2) is calibrated using the Type 1 error
              rate, relying on the assumption that the true difference is zero,
              which makes no sense in many applications. We set up a more
              relevant framework in which a true comparison can be positive or
              negative, and, based on the data, you can state ``$\vartheta$1 >

              the Type S (for sign) error, which occurs when you claim
              ``$\vartheta$1 > $\vartheta$2 with confidence'' when
              $\vartheta$2> $\vartheta$1 (or vice-versa). We compute the Type S

              find that classical Type S error rates can be extremely high (up
              to 50\%). Bayesian confidence statements are conservative, in the
              sense that claims based on 95\% posterior intervals have Type S
              error rates between 0 and 2.5\%. For multiple comparison

  abstract = "PURPOSE: The ability to properly analyze and interpret large
              microbiome data sets has lagged behind our ability to acquire
              such data sets from environmental or clinical samples. Sequencing
              instruments impose a structure on these data: the natural sample
              space of a 16S rRNA gene sequencing data set is a simplex, which
              is a part of real space that is restricted to nonnegative values
              with a constant sum. Such data are compositional and should be
              analyzed using compositionally appropriate tools and approaches.
              However, most of the tools for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis
              assume these data are unrestricted. METHODS: We show that
              existing tools for compositional data (CoDa) analysis can be
              readily adapted to analyze high-throughput sequencing data sets.
              RESULTS: The Human Microbiome Project tongue versus buccal mucosa
              data set shows how the CoDa approach can address the major
              elements of microbiome analysis. Reanalysis of a publicly
              available autism microbiome data set shows that the CoDa approach
              in concert with multiple hypothesis test corrections prevent
              false positive identifications. CONCLUSIONS: The CoDa approach is
              readily scalable to microbiome-sized analyses. We provide example

               is rarely acknowledged, but ignoring it can result in many false
               positive inferences. We demonstrate that examination of point
               estimates of the data can result in false positive results, even
               with appropriate zero replacement approaches, using an in vitro

               approximated, and hence accounted for, by Monte-Carlo sampling
               from the Dirichlet distribution. This approximation when used by
               itself is itself problematic, but becomes useful when coupled
               with a log-ratio approach commonly used in compositional data

              reservoir for opportunistic microbial pathogens that can infect
              hospitalized patients. In 2016, a cluster of clinical
              sphingomonas infections prompted an investigation. METHODS: We
              performed whole-genome DNA sequencing on clinical isolates of
              multidrug-resistant Sphingomonas koreensis identified from 2006
              through 2016 at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical
              Center. We cultured S. koreensis from the sinks in patient rooms
              and performed both whole-genome and shotgun metagenomic
              sequencing to identify a reservoir within the infrastructure of
              the hospital. These isolates were compared with clinical and
              environmental S. koreensis isolates obtained from other
              institutions. RESULTS: The investigation showed that two isolates
              of S. koreensis obtained from the six patients identified in the
              2016 cluster were unrelated, but four isolates shared more than
              99.92\% genetic similarity and were resistant to multiple
              antibiotic agents. Retrospective analysis of banked clinical
              isolates of sphingomonas from the NIH Clinical Center revealed
              the intermittent recovery of a clonal strain over the past
              decade. Unique single-nucleotide variants identified in strains
              of S. koreensis elucidated the existence of a reservoir in the
              hospital plumbing. Clinical S. koreensis isolates from other
              facilities were genetically distinct from the NIH isolates.
              Hospital remediation strategies were guided by results of
              microbiologic culturing and fine-scale genomic analyses.
              CONCLUSIONS: This genomic and epidemiologic investigation
              suggests that S. koreensis is an opportunistic human pathogen
              that both persisted in the NIH Clinical Center infrastructure
              across time and space and caused health care-associated
              infections. (Funded by the NIH Intramural Research Programs.).",

               potential pathogens in isolation. To develop a community-level
               understanding of how microorganisms colonize and move through
               the hospital environment, we characterized the bacterial
               dynamics among hospital surfaces, patients, and staff over the
               course of 1 year as a new hospital became operational. The
               bacteria in patient rooms, particularly on bedrails,
               consistently resembled the skin microbiota of the patient
               occupying the room. Bacterial communities on patients and room
               surfaces became increasingly similar over the course of a
               patient's stay. Temporal correlations in community structure
               demonstrated that patients initially acquired room-associated
               taxa that predated their stay but that their own microbial
               signatures began to influence the room community structure over
               time. The $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity of patient skin
               samples were only weakly or nonsignificantly associated with
               clinical factors such as chemotherapy, antibiotic usage, and
               surgical recovery, and no factor except for ambulatory status
               affected microbial similarity between the microbiotas of a
               patient and their room. Metagenomic analyses revealed that genes
               conferring antimicrobial resistance were consistently more
               abundant on room surfaces than on the skin of the patients
               inhabiting those rooms. In addition, persistent unique genotypes
               of Staphylococcus and Propionibacterium were identified. Dynamic
               Bayesian network analysis suggested that hospital staff were
               more likely to be a source of bacteria on the skin of patients
               than the reverse but that there were no universal patterns of

              by the synergistic interactions of physical and biological
              factors. In our motivating data, ocean microbiome samples were
              collected from the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf, Monterey Bay at
              multiple time points and then 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequenced.
              We develop a Bayesian semiparametric regression model to
              investigate how microbial abundance and succession change with
              covarying physical and biological factors including algal bloom
              and domoic acid concentration level using 16S rRNA sequencing
              data. A generalized linear regression model is built using the
              Laplace prior, a sparse inducing prior, to improve estimation of
              covariate effects on mean abundances of microbial species
              represented by operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A
              nonparametric prior model is used to facilitate borrowing
              strength across OTUs, across samples and across time points. It
              flexibly estimates baseline mean abundances of OTUs and provides
              the basis for improved quantification of covariate effects. The
              proposed method does not require prior normalization of OTU
              counts to adjust differences in sample total counts. Instead, the
              normalization and estimation of covariate effects on OTU
              abundance are simultaneously carried out for joint analysis of
              all OTUs. Using simulation studies and a real data analysis, we

                   hierarchical models with applications in many fields.
                   Performing Bayesian inference on such models can be
                   challenging as Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms struggle
                   with the geometry of the resulting posterior distribution
                   and can be prohibitively slow. An alternative is to use a

                   hyperparameters using dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a

              for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and cyanoDB (Cyanobacteria
              only) taxonomies to a de novo tree comprising 408,315 sequences.
              We also incorporated explicit rank information provided by the
              NCBI taxonomy to group names (by prefixing rank designations) for
              better user orientation and classification consistency. The
              resulting merged taxonomy improved the classification of 75\% of
              the sequences by one or more ranks relative to the original NCBI
              taxonomy with the most pronounced improvements occurring in
              under-classified environmental sequences. We also assessed
              candidate phyla (divisions) currently defined by NCBI and present

               modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in
               today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to
               perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated.
               This unique computational approach ensures that readers
               understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and
               interpretations in their own modeling work. The text presents
               generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian
               perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of
               Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the
               basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also
               discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process
               models for spatial and network autocorrelation. By using
               complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a
               practical foundation for performing statistical inference.
               Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the

              in multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) transmission is important
              and well studied; however, the role of patient hand contamination
              needs to be characterized further. METHODS: Patients from 2
              hospitals in southeast Michigan were recruited within 24 hours of
              arrival to their room and followed prospectively using microbial
              surveillance of nares, dominant hand, and 6 high-touch
              environmental surfaces. Sampling was performed on admission, days
              3 and 7, and weekly until discharge. Paired samples of
              methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from
              the patients' hand and room surfaces were evaluated for
              relatedness using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and
              staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec, and Panton-Valentine
              leukocidin typing. RESULTS: A total of 399 patients (mean age,
              60.8 years; 49\% male) were enrolled and followed for 710 visits.
              Fourteen percent (n = 56/399) of patients were colonized with an
              MDRO at baseline; 10\% (40/399) had an MDRO on their hands.
              Twenty-nine percent of rooms harbored an MDRO. Six percent
              (14/225 patients with at least 2 visits) newly acquired an MDRO
              on their hands during their stay. New MDRO acquisition in
              patients occurred at a rate of 24.6/1000 patient-days, and in
              rooms at a rate of 58.6/1000 patient-days. Typing demonstrated a
              high correlation between MRSA on patient hands and room surfaces.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that patient hand contamination
              with MDROs is common and correlates with contamination on
              high-touch room surfaces. Patient hand hygiene protocols should
              be considered to reduce transmission of pathogens and

                   selection for generalized linear models with scarce but
                   high-dimensional data. We argue that in many cases one can
                   benefit from a decision theoretically justified two-stage
                   approach: first, construct a possibly non-sparse model that
                   predicts well, and then find a minimal subset of features
                   that characterize the predictions. The model built in the
                   first step is referred to as the
                   \textbackslashemph\{reference model\} and the operation
                   during the latter step as predictive
                   \textbackslashemph\{projection\}. The key characteristic of
                   this approach is that it finds an excellent tradeoff between
                   sparsity and predictive accuracy, and the gain comes from
                   utilizing all available information including prior and that
                   coming from the left out features. We review several methods
                   that follow this principle and provide novel methodological
                   contributions. We present a new projection technique that
                   unifies two existing techniques and is both accurate and
                   fast to compute. We also propose a way of evaluating the
                   feature selection process using fast leave-one-out
                   cross-validation that allows for easy and intuitive model
                   size selection. Furthermore, we prove a theorem that helps
                   to understand the conditions under which the projective
                   approach could be beneficial. The benefits are illustrated
                   via several simulated and real world examples.",

              marcescens outbreak after recognizing the sink traps as the
              source of transmission. METHODS: The Sheba Medical Center
              intensive care unit (ICU), contains 16 single-bed, semi-closed
              rooms. Active CPE surveillance includes twice-weekly rectal
              screening of all patients. A case was defined as a patient
              detected with OXA-48 CPE >72 hours after admission. A root-cause
              analysis was used to investigate the outbreak. All samples were
              inoculated on chrom-agar CRE, and carbapenemase genes were
              detected using commercial molecular Xpert-Carba-R. Environmental
              and patient S. marcescens isolates were characterized using PFGE.
              RESULTS: From January 2016 to May 2017, 32 OXA-48 CPE cases were
              detected, and 81\% of these were S. marcescens. A single clone
              was the cause of all but the first 2 cases. The common factor in
              all cases was the use of relatively large amounts of tap water.
              The outbreak clone was detected in 2 sink outlets and 16 sink
              traps. In addition to routine strict infection control measures,
              measures taken to contain the outbreak included (1) various sink
              decontamination efforts, which eliminated the bacteria from the
              sink drains only temporarily and (2) educational intervention
              that engaged the ICU team and lead to high adherence to
              'sink-contamination prevention guidelines.' No additional cases
              were detected for 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Despite persistence of
              the outbreak clones in the environmental reservoir for 1 year,
              the outbreak was rapidly and successfully contained. Addressing
              sink traps as hidden reservoirs played a major role in the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clostridium difficile spores persist in
              hospital environments for an extended period. We evaluated
              whether admission to a room previously occupied by a patient with
              C. difficile infection (CDI) increased the risk of acquiring CDI.
              DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Medical intensive
              care unit (ICU) at a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: Patients
              admitted from January 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006, were
              evaluated for a diagnosis of CDI 48 hours after ICU admission and
              within 30 days after ICU discharge. Medical, ICU, and pharmacy
              records were reviewed for other CDI risk factors. Admitted
              patients who did develop CDI were compared with admitted patients
              who did not. RESULTS: Among 1,844 patients admitted to the ICU,
              134 CDI cases were identified. After exclusions, 1,770 admitted
              patients remained for analysis. Of the patients who acquired CDI
              after admission to the ICU, 4.6\% had a prior occupant without
              CDI, whereas 11.0\% had a prior occupant with CDI (P = .002). The
              effect of room on CDI acquisition remained a significant risk
              factor (P = .008) when Kaplan-Meier curves were used. The prior
              occupant's CDI status remained significant (p = .01; hazard
              ratio, 2.35) when controlling for the current patient's age,
              Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score,
              exposure to proton pump inhibitors, and antibiotic use.
              CONCLUSIONS: A prior room occupant with CDI is a significant risk
              factor for CDI acquisition, independent of established CDI risk
              factors. These findings have implications for room placement and
              hospital design.",

                   applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for
                   estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from
                   a fitted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated
                   at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO
                   and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of
                   predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in
                   practice because they involve additional computational
                   steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO
                   and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation
                   draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using
                   Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure
                   for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is
                   asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is
                   more robust in the finite case with weak priors or
                   influential observations. As a byproduct of our
                   calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for
                   estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive
                   errors between two models. We implement the computations in
                   an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit
                   with the Bayesian inference package Stan.",
